                <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                    thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicin .
                    Over a series of exhibits we explore
                    the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery
                    of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                    Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of
                    evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding
                    our place in this world.
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                    evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who did not
                    survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too

                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, The Sky Above Us,
                    explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                    We will locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
                    a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileos
                    telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
                    important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
                    not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                    including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus
                    on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
