                        You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing,
                        or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?

                    <p> During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where

                        Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.</p>

                    <p> To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join,
