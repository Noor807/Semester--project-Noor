        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
            insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
            thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
            the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery
            of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
            observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
            Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of
            evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding
            our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
            evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who did not
            survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too</p>

        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, The Sky Above Us,
            explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
            We will locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
            a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileos
            telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
            important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
            not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
            including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus
            on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>

        <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
        <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the
            science of the future.
            From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the
            future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

        <p>Visiting Professor of Aeronautics
            It is our pleasure to announce that <b> Prof Sheila Widnall</b> from the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on the development of
            aeronautics and where the future lies in this exciting
            <b>space Night in the Museum</b>

            Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over
            beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready
            to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.
            Energetica Exhibition on Loan

            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the <b> Energetica exhibition</b>
            is coming to the Community Science Museum. It is a series of installations that
            allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them.
            From solar energy powering lighting, to Wind Island that shows how turbines
            are able to use and control wind to create power.
