                    <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
                    <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                        insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicin .
                        Over a series of exhibits we explore
                        the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery
                        of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                        observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                    <h2>Evolution</h2>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                        Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of
                        evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding
                        our place in this world.
                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                        evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who did not
                        survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too

                        explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                        We will locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
                        a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                        telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                        important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
                        not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                        including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus
                        on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
